# EXAM: Programming Basics

### Getting Started
 - Fork this repository under your own account
 - Clone the forked repository to your computer
 - Create a `.gitignore` file so generated files won't be committed
 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Don't push your work** to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up

#### Your answer:
[add your answer here]   
1:   
2: return type  
3: method name  
4: inside the parentheses: the method's _signature_  
   "int n" means the method requires an argument of type _int_  
5: "n" will be the name given to the _int_ type argument variable  
   _inside the method's scope_  
6: declaration part of a variable initialization.   
   (In the example: first word is the variable type, second is the variable name.)  
7: body of the method  
8: return statement  

### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
#### Your answer:
A special method in a class, which gets called every time 
a new object instance is created based on that class.  
The constructor's name is always the same as the name of the class it belongs to.
